## 2026-09-11 — Storage recovery and native history replay

- Keep the desktop open after local storage exhaustion. Preserve the original
  database and saved drafts; use temporary storage only for rebuildable cache
  data. Failed draft saves block window close, with an explicit Retry saving
  action after space is freed. An incomplete legacy credential migration keeps
  its original settings protected and requires reopening after recovery.
- Prevent failed event-cache batches from advancing the durable history cursor.
  Handle browser storage quota errors in layout controls without crashing React.
  Recovery is user-triggered, with no new storage or inbox polling.
- Recognize the server's exact source-proven native replay marker. Keep original
  human messages and scheduled reports, suppress only verified imported copies,
  and preserve the correction when an older cached response arrives later.
- Verified disk-full startup, preserved drafts, failed-close handling and a
  successful explicit retry using the actual desktop service, SQLite, IPC,
  preload and renderer with isolated fault injection. The system disk was not
  filled, and no provider turn was started by this check.
- Verified the native replay correction in the actual isolated Electron UI:
  duplicate history is removed while the original human message, scheduled
  report and genuine later question remain, including after switching chats
  and reloading. Preserve unmatched output across silent imported boundaries.
- Accepted local arm64 candidate: `0.2.13-beta.33` build `186`, source `a4fc5ba1`.
  Developer ID signature and all 86 compiled archive files verified. Automatic
  updates are disabled; the app is not notarized or publicly released, and the
  installed/running app was not replaced. Historical corrections and passive
  mailbox reads require standalone server `0.1.26-beta.61`.

## 2026-09-11 — Passive agent mailbox

- Show passive incoming agent messages as compact purple sender groups in
  chronological position. Only adjacent messages are grouped; human follow-ups
  and progress remain boundaries. Preserve individual identities and replies.
- Expand and delete exact messages on demand. Opening a message does not mark
  it read by the agent. Long expanded bodies have a bounded scroll surface.
- Use the existing event stream, without inbox polling or duplicate execution
  queue rows. Grouping is linear and preserves immutable cached inputs.
- Verified the actual desktop main process, cache, IPC and renderer with
  synthetic transport: grouping, edited full-body scrolling, exact deletion,
  read-state updates and reopening. This is not a live-provider execution test.
- Requires the matching standalone server mailbox contract. No server
  deployment or public release is included in this local implementation.
- Accepted local arm64 candidate: `0.2.13-beta.33` build `185`, source `bac1876e`.
  Developer ID signature and all 86 compiled archive files verified. Automatic
  updates are disabled; this candidate is not notarized or published, and the
  installed/running app was not replaced.

## 2026-09-11 — Scheduled history ownership

- Keep explicitly job-owned output inside Scheduled Job cards even when a
  paged response omits the start event or scheduled-purpose field. Match cold
  history, incremental updates, and late ownership metadata.
- Preserve ordinary imported/user messages and independently rendered
  emergency, Mail, and cross-chat receipts.
- Older Claude imports also require the standalone server's source-proven
  historical-page correction; this desktop change does not replace that repair.
- Local arm64 candidate: `0.2.13-beta.33` build `184`, source `3088ead6`.
  Production build, signature and all compiled archive files verified; not
  notarized or published. The installed/running app was left untouched.

## 2026-09-11 — Expanded queued messages

- Keep expanded message rows at their natural height so the queue scrolls
  instead of clipping the body. The queue retains its existing height limit.
- Verified long Codex and Claude messages with wheel scrolling to the final
  paragraph, reachable queue actions, and collapse in light/dark narrow views
  using the actual desktop renderer and synthetic transport.
- Accepted local arm64 candidate: `0.2.13-beta.33` build `183`, source
  `a300d1d9`. Signature and compiled archive verified; not notarized or
  published. No server update is required.

## 2026-09-11 — Chronological agent messages

- Place agent messages between the progress before and after their send or
  delivery-start event. Keep the sender's live or stopped state below the
  message, and retain that position when delivery receipts arrive later.
- Preserve earlier answers during incremental receipt updates. Keep tool
  calls and results together when activity is split around a message, including
  explicitly loaded trace pages.
- Preserve full queued message bodies, recipient edits, and compare-and-swap
  revisions during stream updates and stale receipt replay.
- Do not display scheduled-job input as a public result. Preserve genuine
  user-authored quotations of provider control text.
- Validated live, completed, queued-reply, and reopened views in the actual
  desktop renderer with synthetic Codex and Claude transport. Checked both
  themes, narrow layout, and typing/scrolling in long cached conversations.
  This does not certify live provider execution, server history pagination,
  or minimap navigation. No server deployment or public release is included.
- Accepted local desktop candidate: `0.2.13-beta.33` build `182`, arm64,
  source `22a19ce1`. Developer ID signature and compiled archive contents
  verified. Final desktop UI pass includes stop-after-send, late delivery
  receipts, and reopening for both providers. This candidate is not notarized
  or published, and its automatic updater is disabled.

## 2026-09-11 — Current desktop development

- Bring current desktop changes into this repository: source-proven history
  deduplication, readable asynchronous agent-message queues, revision-safe
  recipient edits, explicit Send now priority, and actual chat names.
- Include on-demand Mail threads, agent-only replies, searchable chat routing,
  guarded Host rename, negotiated unlimited chat routes, and Team Network
  translations. Quiet arrival hints update a badge without polling Inbox
  contents or navigating away from the current chat.
- Include native provider skills and commands in the slash palette, retaining
  capability negotiation and unsupported-server fallbacks.
- Preserve synthetic test data, the source-only CI boundary, and the existing
  public binary update feed. No release, native mobile build, or server
  deployment is part of this source migration.
- Validation: desktop type checks, the complete desktop test run, and the
  production bundle build passed. Local validation used Node 26; source CI
  remains pinned to the documented Node 24 environment.

## Source verification

- Mobile CI now runs the cross-chat protocol, projection, route/queue race,
  rendering, recipient-picker, and native-workspace resolution regressions.
- The additional checks use synthetic data and mocked native boundaries;
  source CI still does not build signed applications or publish releases.

## Documentation

- Reorganized the README into a product overview, installation steps, and
  separate desktop, mobile, and website development workflows.
- Clarified the client/server boundary, current versus legacy client sources,
  and the distinction between local builds and release publishing.
- Checked development commands against package scripts and source CI, and
  checked installation guidance against the standalone server documentation.

## Mobile cross-chat parity — 0.1.1 (171)

- Apple validation and processing completed successfully; build 171 is active
  for internal TestFlight testing with automatic notifications enabled.
  External beta review was not submitted. Binary source: `aa1153be`.
- Align mobile with the current desktop async agent-message protocol: one
  Markdown card per message, pending incoming messages in the queue, and
  delivery-time chronology without duplicating internal provider prompts.
- Show granted chat access, pending grants, route limits, loading/errors, and
  revision-safe Revoke controls. Reconnects fence stale requests and callbacks.
- Add exact queued-message removal with truthful confirmation, duplicate-tap
  protection, and desktop purple pending-message styling.
- Include offline server inboxes in `@@` discovery and distinguish capability-gated
  `@@bulletin` posts from `@@all` inbox broadcasts.
- Validate real component handlers against synthetic native hosts, projection
  and store/API race regressions, broad library tests, and native build checks.
  Synthetic rendering does not substitute for physical-device touch/pixel QA.
- Release preparation uses generated, ignored native projects and resolves the
  configured workspace name rather than assuming the legacy project name.
- Signed arm64 iPhone/iPad archive and exported IPA passed deep signature,
  framework ABI, version, production-entitlement, and matching-symbol checks.
  The production JavaScript bundle contains the new features and excludes the
  visual test fixture.

## Source snapshot
