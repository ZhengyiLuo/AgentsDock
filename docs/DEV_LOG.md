# Public development log

## 2026-09-11 — Current desktop development

- Bring current desktop changes into this repository: source-proven history
  deduplication, readable asynchronous agent-message queues, revision-safe
  recipient edits, explicit Send now priority, and actual chat names.
- Include on-demand Mail threads, agent-only replies, searchable chat routing,
  guarded Host rename, negotiated unlimited chat routes, and Team Network
  translations. Quiet arrival hints update a badge without polling Inbox
  contents or navigating away from the current chat.
- Include native provider skills and commands in the slash palette, retaining
  capability negotiation and unsupported-server fallbacks.
- Preserve synthetic test data, the source-only CI boundary, and the existing
  public binary update feed. No release, native mobile build, or server
  deployment is part of this source migration.
- Validation: desktop type checks, the complete desktop test run, and the
  production bundle build passed. Local validation used Node 26; source CI
  remains pinned to the documented Node 24 environment.

## Source verification

- Mobile CI now runs the cross-chat protocol, projection, route/queue race,
  rendering, recipient-picker, and native-workspace resolution regressions.
- The additional checks use synthetic data and mocked native boundaries;
  source CI still does not build signed applications or publish releases.

## Documentation

- Reorganized the README into a product overview, installation steps, and
  separate desktop, mobile, and website development workflows.
- Clarified the client/server boundary, current versus legacy client sources,
  and the distinction between local builds and release publishing.
- Checked development commands against package scripts and source CI, and
  checked installation guidance against the standalone server documentation.

## Mobile cross-chat parity — 0.1.1 (171)

- Apple validation and processing completed successfully; build 171 is active
  for internal TestFlight testing with automatic notifications enabled.
  External beta review was not submitted. Binary source: `aa1153be`.
- Align mobile with the current desktop async agent-message protocol: one
  Markdown card per message, pending incoming messages in the queue, and
  delivery-time chronology without duplicating internal provider prompts.
- Show granted chat access, pending grants, route limits, loading/errors, and
  revision-safe Revoke controls. Reconnects fence stale requests and callbacks.
- Add exact queued-message removal with truthful confirmation, duplicate-tap
  protection, and desktop purple pending-message styling.
- Include offline server inboxes in `@@` discovery and distinguish capability-gated
  `@@bulletin` posts from `@@all` inbox broadcasts.
- Validate real component handlers against synthetic native hosts, projection
  and store/API race regressions, broad library tests, and native build checks.
  Synthetic rendering does not substitute for physical-device touch/pixel QA.
- Release preparation uses generated, ignored native projects and resolves the
  configured workspace name rather than assuming the legacy project name.
- Signed arm64 iPhone/iPad archive and exported IPA passed deep signature,
  framework ABI, version, production-entitlement, and matching-symbol checks.
  The production JavaScript bundle contains the new features and excludes the
  visual test fixture.

## Source snapshot

- Includes the Electron desktop and React Native mobile clients, legacy Swift
  targets, compatibility fixtures, and project documentation.
- Private development history, operational incident notes, and unreviewed
  screenshots and recordings are not included.
- This source snapshot does not itself publish or change any installed release.

Future entries should describe public-facing changes and validation without
including credentials, user data, private infrastructure, or internal history.
